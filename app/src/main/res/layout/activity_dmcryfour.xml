You can still perform Dreadnaught with an empty Royal gauge and get about five seconds of invulnerability. You will also suffer limited movement during a Dreadnaught. Perform Dreadnaught, and at the precise moment it runs out, switch your melee weapon (R2). If done quickly enough, you will keep the Dreadnaught armor and be able to move normally.

Charge a shot. Activate Devil Trigger mode. Release the shot, maybe a few more. Turn off Devil Trigger mode, and repeat. This will quickly give you Super Smokin Stylish before he has even dropped his shield. This will work even with a level 1 Charge Shot, but is much easier if you have level 3. Once his shield is gone, use Devil Trigger mode again. Use the Devil Bringer to devastate him. Three throws should be enough to send him into red mode. Once he goes red, he will try to grab you and kill himself to seriously drain your life or kill you. Shoot normal shots at him to get more Smokin Stylish points and defeat him.Use the following trick to defeat a Blitz with Dante. Use the Royal Guard style along with the Gilgamesh gauntlets. While the Blitz is in his yellow electricity shield state, get close to him and press [Melee] + [Style] repeatedly and quickly. You will be performing a punch and canceling it with a Royal Block very quickly. Think of the [Style] move as the attack. Try to constantly use [Melee] + [Style] repeatedly. You will raise the letter grade of your style meter with each hit, and quickly lower the electric shielding. You are basically hitting the shield yourself, then blocking that hit so fast that you cannot see it happen. Again, just press [Melee] + [Style] at the same time. This may be somewhat tricky at first, but eventually becomes easy. Once his shield is lowered, quickly switch to swordmaster style. Use Real Impact uppercut with the Gilgamesh gauntlets at least twice. Perform a Kick 13 if time permits, and/or a Shocking. He will go into his overdriven Red Mode. Quickly switch to Lucifer, and perform Bondage. If done correctly, you should defeat him and get a huge stylish ranking from one Blitz."
